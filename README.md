## About

WebBlockerScript is a simple command-line tool written in Batch script that allows users to easily block access to specific websites on their Windows computer by modifying the hosts file. This tool provides a user-friendly menu system that allows users to add custom websites to block, remove blocked websites, and even backup and restore their hosts file. It is designed to be easy to use and requires no technical knowledge or expertise to operate. This tool can be useful for parents who want to limit their children's access to certain websites or for anyone who wants to improve their productivity by blocking distracting websites during work hours.
